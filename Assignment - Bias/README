This program creates generates 100 datasets from a known funcion 𝑓 (𝑥) = 2 cos 2.8𝑥 + 7.5 with added noise
following normal distribution 𝒩 0, 1 . For each dataset, use the same 20 instances with
𝑥 ∈ [0, 5] following uniform distribution. For each of 100 datasets, perform polynomial fits
of order 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. (a) Plot only the first five polynomial fits (using solid line) for
each polynomial order and the average of the 100 fits (using dotted line), you do not
have to show the 20 sample points. Plot the five polynomial fits of each order in a
separate figure.
